HestiaPi's case comes in 2 parts. The backplate that goes to the wall and
should not be visible and the front cover. The backplate should have 4 small
holes, 3 larger holes and an opening for the wires coming from the wall.

\begin{itemize}
\item 4x 2.5Mx8mm hex screws
\item 4x 2.5M hex nuts
\end{itemize}

For attaching to the wall you need:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3x 3.5Mx40mm non-countersunk screws (or whatever you have that fits)
\end{itemize}

Place the hex nuts in the 4 small recesses on the side of the backplate that
will face the wall. Bolt the HestiaPi PCB to the backplate using the hex
screws. They should just be snug. Do not overtighten.

Plave the backplate on the wall with the opening of the backplate lining up
with the location of the wires from your HVAC system. With the larger three
holes, mark your wall and drill holes smaller than your remaining screws.
Secure the backplate to the wall with the 3 larger screws.

Complete wiring according to your model instructions (for US see Figure
\ref{fig:us}; for EU see Figure \ref{fig:eu})

Remove any protective film from the LCD if present and lock the LCD on the
cover from the inside making sure the LCD's header is at the top.

Attach the 4 wire cable to the temperature sensor, making sure that the red
wire is connected to the Vin pin.

Guide the 4 wires through the slit of bottom partition of the cover and secure
the sensor in it so that it is thermally protected from the rest of the
circuit. Note that the sensor, the little shiny square, should ideally be
placed facing outwards and not be blocked by any plastic piece of the case. The
red wire (Vin) goes to the top pin (Vin) on the PCB.

Hold the front cover aligned to the backplate and bring closer while you make
sure the pin header of the PCB is aligned to the header of the LCD. Push firmly
from the sides of the cover (not on the LCD screen) until it locks in place.

Make sure no wires are squished between as this may block the cover from
locking in place securely, or could cause issues with the touch screen.

It is critical that the pins for the LCD are lined up correctly before powering
on your HVAC system. If they are offset, there's a risk of damaging the screen.

Once everything is connected, turn on the breaker to your HVAC system. If your
HVAC unit can not power the HestiaPi and need to plug the thermostat into an
outlet, plug it into the wall now.
