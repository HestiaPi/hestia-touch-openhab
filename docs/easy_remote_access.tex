All latest releases of HestiaPi offer very easy remote access to your home
without touching your network modem/router or even knowing HestiaPi's IP! Does
not depend on port forwarding or DynDNS! Woohooo!

\textbf{Please note that this is an externally hosted service not controlled by
you or us but by OpenHAB itself.}

prefer video to text)

To activate it (shipped disabled by default for obvious reasons) go to
http://[YOUR-HESTIAPI-IP]:8080/paperui and select Add-ons > MISC and make
sure ``openHAB Cloud Connector'' is installed.

Once installed SSH into your HestiaPi (username: pi and password: hestia) and
type:

\texttt{    cat /var/lib/openhab2/uuid}

 copy the output somewhere. Then type:

\texttt{        cat /var/lib/openhab2/openhabcloud/secret}

copy this output too. Reboot your HestiaPi

\texttt{        sudo reboot}

    
Then go to \url{https://myopenhab.org} and create an account using your details
and the above information (UUID and secret).

You can now access your HestiaPi Touch from a browser or your mobile app

Hint: Enter \url{https://myopenhab.org} as a remote url and your myopenHAB
account username and password as credentials
