Follow the on-screen instructions on the LCD when it prompts to connect your
phone to the ``HESTIAPI'' network with HESTIAPI as the password. Once connected
you will automatically be prompted on your phone to select your WiFi network
from a list (no hidden SSID supported yet) and enter the password. This should
look similar to what is in figure \ref{fig:wifi_setup}).

Your HestiaPi will then restart to connect to your network and the HESTIAPI
network will not be shown again if you entered the correct the details.
