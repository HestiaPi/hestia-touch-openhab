These instructions will help you prepare to install your thermostat onto the
wall.

\begin{enumerate}
\item If you didn't buy your HestiaPi with a pre-flashed a MicroSD card, follow
      the instructions from section \ref{Quick Installation} to flash one.
\item Insert the MicroSD card into the Raspberry Pi. Just push it in. It
      does not click. It does not lock in place. A tiny part of it will stick
      out just enough to grab and pull it if needed.
\item Turn off the breaker for your HVAC system to make sure you are not
      working with live electrical wires!
\item Open your old thermostat, mark the wires so you know which goes where,
      and then disconnect everything and remove the old thermostat from the
      wall.
\end{enumerate}

At this point you are ready to install the thermostat using the instructions in
section \ref{Wall Installation ONE}.
